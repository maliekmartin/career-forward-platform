## Technical & Troubleshooting

### Q: How do I report a bug?

A: We appreciate you reporting bugs! Please email support@careerforward.io with the subject line "Bug Report:" and include the following information: what you were trying to do, what happened instead, any error messages displayed, your browser and operating system, and steps to reproduce the issue. Screenshots or videos are helpful too. We prioritize bug reports and typically investigate within 24 hours to help resolve technical issues quickly.

### Q: Why is the site running slowly?

A: If you're experiencing slow performance, try these troubleshooting steps: first, clear your browser cache and cookies, then close and reopen your browser. If the issue persists, try a different browser to determine if it's specific to your current browser. Check your internet connection by testing other websites, and restart your router if needed. We recommend using Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge for the best experience. If performance is still slow, email support@careerforward.io with your browser details and we'll investigate server-side issues.

### Q: What browsers are supported?

A: Career Forward works best on modern browsers: Chrome (version 90+), Firefox (version 88+), Safari (version 14+), and Edge (version 90+). We also support mobile browsers on iOS (Safari) and Android (Chrome). For the best experience, we recommend using the latest version of your preferred browser and enabling JavaScript. If you're using an older browser and experiencing issues, please update to the latest version and try again.
