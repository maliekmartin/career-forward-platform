# Career Forward - Organizational & Coach FAQs

## Frequently Asked Questions for Organizations, Coaches & Administrators

---

## ONBOARDING & TEAM SETUP

### Q: How do I onboard my team to Career Forward?

A: Team onboarding is straightforward. First, an administrator creates coach accounts from the Admin Dashboard with their email addresses. Each coach receives an invitation email with setup instructions. Coaches then log in and complete their profile. We recommend setting up 2-3 pilot coaches first to test workflows, then scaling to your full team. Most organizations complete full team setup within 5-7 business days.

### Q: Can I customize Career Forward for my organization's branding?

A: Yes. The platform supports organizational customization including your agency logo, primary and secondary colors, and organization name. These settings are configured through the Admin Dashboard under Organization Settings. Clients see your branding on their dashboards, creating a seamless experience aligned with your workforce development program. Custom branding takes effect immediately across all user interfaces.

### Q: What training is available for my staff?

A: We provide comprehensive training including video tutorials, written guides, and live onboarding sessions. Each coach gets access to a dedicated Training Hub with modules covering caseload management, client progress tracking, outcome reporting, and platform features. We also offer quarterly webinars for ongoing professional development. New users can complete core training in 2-3 hours, with optional advanced modules for specialized features.

### Q: How do I manage user permissions and access levels?

A: The platform supports three role types: Admin (full system access), Coach (client caseload and reporting), and Client (job seeker). Administrators can assign and modify roles through the User Management section of the Admin Dashboard. You can granularly control which coaches see which clients, restrict access to reports, and set data export permissions. Role-based access ensures staff only view data relevant to their responsibilities.

## CLIENT & CASELOAD MANAGEMENT

### Q: How do I add clients/job seekers to my caseload?

A: There are two methods. First, clients can self-register on the platform and send you a connection request through their profile. Second, you can proactively search for clients by email address from your "Add Client" button on the Coach Dashboard. Once found, send a connection request that the client must accept. This two-way confirmation ensures consent while maintaining data privacy. Most coaches add clients within seconds of receiving their email address.

### Q: Can multiple coaches work with the same client?

A: Yes, multiple coaches can connect with one client simultaneously. This is ideal for co-coaching scenarios or when clients transition between coaches. Each coach maintains separate private notes, and all coaches view the same client progress data in real-time. Clients receive notifications when new coaches connect, maintaining transparency. This flexibility supports team-based service delivery models common in workforce agencies.

### Q: How do I communicate with clients through the platform?

A: Career Forward includes an in-app messaging system allowing coaches to send direct messages to clients. Messages appear in clients' notification center and can trigger email notifications based on client preferences. Use messaging for quick check-ins, progress updates, and urgent communications. For sensitive matters, you can also reference clients' email addresses for external communication. Messages are logged for compliance and accountability.

### Q: How do I track client progress effectively?

A: The Client Detail View provides a comprehensive progress snapshot including current Career Forward stage (with percentage completion), completed assessments, resumes created, and job applications logged. The Activity Timeline shows exactly what actions clients took and when. Use filters to identify clients needing attention—those inactive 7+ days appear in your "Needs Attention" dashboard. Real-time progress tracking eliminates manual status updates and keeps your team informed.

## OUTCOME TRACKING & REPORTING

### Q: How does outcome tracking work?

A: Career Forward automatically tracks five key outcomes: (1) Stage completion within the Career Forward pathway, (2) Resume creation, (3) Job applications logged, (4) Training video completion, and (5) Assessment participation. These metrics populate automatically as clients use the platform. You don't manually enter data—the system captures actions in real-time. This reduces administrative burden while providing accurate, auditable outcome documentation required by funders.

### Q: What reports can I generate for funders?

A: Career Forward generates three primary report types. Individual client reports show progression through the Career Forward pathway, skills developed, job search activity, and outcomes achieved. Caseload overview reports aggregate statistics across all clients, showing participation rates, completion metrics, and demographic breakdowns. Custom date-range reports allow you to report on specific funding periods. All reports export to PDF with your organization's branding and are funder-ready for grant compliance.

### Q: What data can I export?

A: You can export comprehensive datasets including caseload demographics, progress metrics, outcome summaries, and detailed activity logs. Exports are available in CSV format for analysis in Excel or your data warehouse. You maintain full control—export only data you need for specific purposes. All data exports are timestamped and logged for HIPAA/FERPA compliance. Exports include only clients connected to your account, ensuring data security across multi-organization deployments.

### Q: How do I measure ROI (Return on Investment)?

A: Career Forward provides measurable ROI metrics including: (1) Time saved on administrative tasks (estimated 4-6 hours/week per coach), (2) Increased client engagement through real-time tracking, (3) Reduced time from intake to job application logging (typical 40% reduction), and (4) Improved outcome documentation reducing manual reporting effort. Track your baseline outcomes before implementing Career Forward, then compare post-implementation. Most organizations see positive ROI within 90 days through efficiency gains and improved outcome tracking.

## PLATFORM FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY

### Q: How do I track measurable skill gains?

A: The platform tracks skill development through multiple pathways. Clients log skills in resumes (mapped to job requirements), complete assessments that identify skill gaps, and watch training videos on specific competencies. The system creates a skills inventory showing baseline and developed skills over time. You can review skill progression in each client's profile and correlate training completion with job match improvements. This demonstrates tangible skill development to funders and clients.

### Q: What integrations are available?

A: Career Forward integrates with WorkSourceWA job board for real-time job listings, allowing clients to apply directly within the platform. The Affinda resume parser automatically extracts data from uploaded resumes, reducing manual entry and improving accuracy. Email integration through Resend enables transactional communications (verification, password resets, notifications). These integrations work seamlessly—clients see no disruption while your team gets reliable, connected data flows.

### Q: Can the platform handle special populations (disabilities, ESL, barriers to employment)?

A: Yes. The platform is WCAG AA accessible for users with visual, auditory, and mobility disabilities. Multi-language support includes English, Spanish, Russian, and Ukrainian. The flexible pathway allows clients to progress at their own pace through Career Forward stages. Coaches can add extensive private notes documenting barriers and accommodations. The system doesn't force linear progression, supporting individualized service models common in disability employment and WIOA programs.

### Q: How is client data protected?

A: All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest in our database. We implement role-based access control so coaches only see connected clients. All data access is logged in the Audit Log for compliance verification. The platform supports HIPAA/FERPA-compliant deployments through privacy controls and data retention policies. User passwords use industry-standard bcrypt encryption. Regular security audits and penetration testing ensure data safety. Your organization maintains full control over data deletion and export.

## WORKFLOW & EFFICIENCY

### Q: How does the Client Detail View help me manage my caseload?

A: The Client Detail View consolidates all essential client information in one location. Tabs show Overview (progress snapshot), Resumes (preview and download PDFs), Job Tracker (application history), Notes (your private coaching notes), and Activity (complete action timeline). You see exactly where each client is in their journey without switching between screens. This centralized view reduces time searching for information and helps you provide informed coaching during check-ins.

### Q: How can I identify clients needing attention?

A: The Dashboard prominently displays "Clients Needing Attention"—automatically flagged clients inactive 7+ days, 14+ days, or per your custom threshold. Filter your client list by status (Active, Inactive, At-Risk) to prioritize outreach. Yellow/Red status indicators visually identify at-risk clients. This proactive system ensures no client falls through the cracks and helps you allocate limited coaching time to clients who need it most.

### Q: Can I set automated reminders or alerts?

A: Yes. The notification system alerts you when: (1) A new client sends a connection request, (2) A client completes a Career Forward stage milestone, (3) A client reaches inactivity thresholds, (4) New job matches appear for a client's skills. You can customize alert preferences by notification type. These automated signals reduce the need for manual status checking and ensure timely interventions when clients need support.

### Q: How do I handle disconnecting or transferring a client?

A: Coaches can end a client relationship through the Client Detail View, triggering an automated email to the client explaining the status change. For transitions, add a new coach before removing yourself—the system allows temporary dual coaching. Leave a final note documenting why the relationship ended (graduation, transfer, inactivity). Clients' data remains intact in the system for compliance and future reference.

## REPORTING & COMPLIANCE

### Q: What metrics does Career Forward track for outcome reporting?

A: The platform tracks: completion of Career Forward stages 1-5, resume creation, job application logging, interview training video viewing, career assessment completion, skills identified and developed, job placement (tracked via application status changes), and client engagement frequency. These data points directly correspond to WIOA performance metrics and common funder requirements. No manual data entry is needed—metrics populate automatically.

### Q: How do I download reports for grant submissions?

A: From the Reports section, select your reporting period, choose Individual Client or Caseload Overview format, and click Generate. The system creates a professional PDF with your organization's branding, key metrics, outcome summaries, and demographic information. You can customize which data elements appear. Most reports generate in under 30 seconds. Export them for grant applications, program evaluation, or board presentations.

### Q: How are inactive clients handled?

A: Accounts remain active indefinitely unless clients request deletion. However, you can track inactivity and prioritize re-engagement for long-inactive clients (90+ days). The system helps you document outreach attempts through notes. After account suspension (configurable timeline), we can archive inactive data while maintaining searchability for compliance audits. This balances data retention requirements with database management efficiency.

## ADVANCED FEATURES

### Q: Can I create custom assessments or training content?

A: Career Forward ships with curated assessments (O*NET Interest Profiler, CareerOneStop Skills Matcher, etc.) and interview training videos. Admins can add new video content, external assessment links, and resources through the Content Management dashboard. You cannot create fully custom assessments within the platform, but you can link to external assessments. This hybrid approach balances structured, evidence-based content with flexibility for organizational customization.

### Q: How does the Achievement/Badge system work?

A: Badges automatically unlock when clients meet specific criteria—Profile Pro (100% profile complete), Resume Ready (first resume created), Active Seeker (10+ applications logged), and others. Badges appear on client profiles and in their dashboard, providing motivation and visual progress indicators. Coaches can see badge progress in client overviews. This gamification increases engagement, with clients completing Career Forward stages 40% faster when pursuing badges.

### Q: Can I export caseload data for analysis?

A: Absolutely. Download complete caseload data in CSV format from your Reports dashboard. Include demographics, progress metrics, outcome data, and activity logs. Export to Excel for custom analysis, pivot tables, and visualizations. The timestamp and structured format make it easy to track cohorts over time. Many organizations feed this data into their own dashboards or Learning Management Systems for comprehensive program analysis.
