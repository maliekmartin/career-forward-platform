# Career Forward Platform - Pricing & Billing FAQs

## Frequently Asked Questions

---

### Q: Is Career Forward Platform free for job seekers?

A: Yes, Career Forward is completely free for job seekers. All features including profile creation, resume building, cover letter generation, job tracking, training videos, career assessments, and access to the job board are available at no cost. This free access is permanent—there are no plans to introduce paid tiers for individual job seekers.

---

### Q: How much does Career Forward cost for organizations?

A: We offer flexible paid plans for organizations and workforce development centers on a per-seat basis. Organizations can choose between monthly and annual billing options. Since pricing is customized based on organization size, features needed, and implementation requirements, we ask interested organizations to contact our sales team for a personalized quote. Annual plans typically offer 15-20% savings compared to monthly billing.

---

### Q: What's included in the free tier for job seekers?

A: Job seekers get access to the complete Career Forward platform at no cost, including: unlimited resume creation and storage (up to 3 resumes), AI-powered resume parsing from document uploads, job-matched cover letter generation, comprehensive job application tracking with a stoplight status system, progress tracking through the 5-stage Career Forward pathway, access to interview preparation videos and training resources, career assessments and labor market information, achievement badges and milestone tracking, and integration with the WorkSourceWA job board. There are no hidden limitations or feature restrictions.

---

### Q: Are there any hidden fees or surprise charges?

A: No. We believe in complete transparency with our pricing. For job seekers, all features are free with no hidden costs. For organizations, we clearly outline what's included in the plan and any additional services. There are no surprise setup fees, hidden monthly charges, or unexpected per-transaction costs. If you have specific questions about what's included in an organizational plan, our sales team can provide a detailed breakdown before you commit.

---

### Q: How does billing work for organizations?

A: Organizations can choose between monthly or annual billing cycles. Billing is based on the number of active seats (users) in your organization. The per-seat rate is fixed—there are no overage charges or unexpected costs as your team grows. We provide itemized invoices at the start of each billing cycle, and organizations can manage their seat count by adding or removing users as needed (subject to the billing cycle terms). Payment is processed securely through standard invoice and payment portal methods.

---

### Q: Can organizations get a demo or trial before committing?

A: Absolutely. We strongly encourage organizations to experience Career Forward before purchasing. We offer guided demos where our team walks through platform features relevant to your workforce center's needs. We also provide trial access so your coaches and administrators can explore the platform hands-on, manage test clients, and see how it integrates with your existing workflows. Contact our sales team to schedule a demo or request trial credentials—we typically enable trials within 1-2 business days.

---

### Q: Do you offer discounts for nonprofits or government agencies?

A: Yes, we're committed to supporting workforce development across all sectors. Nonprofits and government agencies (including American Job Centers and state workforce boards) qualify for special pricing on organizational plans. Nonprofit and government discounts typically provide 20-30% off standard per-seat pricing. We also work with eligible organizations on custom arrangements based on mission alignment and community impact. Contact our team to discuss your specific situation and request a nonprofit or government discount quote.

---

### Q: What is your cancellation policy?

A: For month-to-month plans, organizations can cancel their subscription with 30 days' notice. No early termination fees apply. For annual plans, you're committed to the contract term, but if circumstances change, we're willing to discuss options on a case-by-case basis. Upon cancellation, job seekers retain access to their profiles, resumes, and job tracking data for 30 days, allowing them time to export or save important information. After 30 days, the account transitions to read-only mode. We provide clear communication before any account changes occur.

---

### Q: What payment methods do you accept?

A: We accept all major payment methods including credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), ACH bank transfers, and invoice-based billing for organizations. For government and nonprofit organizations, we can accommodate purchase orders and net-30/net-60 invoicing terms. All payments are processed securely through PCI-compliant payment processors. Contact our billing team if you have specific payment method requirements or need to arrange custom payment terms.

---

### Q: Is there a price difference between monthly and annual billing?

A: Yes. Annual plans provide significant savings compared to month-to-month billing. Organizations that commit to annual billing typically save 15-20% on their total subscription cost compared to paying monthly rates. This discount reflects the commitment and allows us to better forecast and plan resources. If budget is a concern, we're happy to discuss flexible payment schedules or discuss other options that might work for your organization.

---

### Q: What happens if we need more or fewer seats during our billing cycle?

A: Seat adjustments are straightforward. If you need to add users during your billing cycle, you'll be billed proactively for the additional seats on a prorated basis through the end of your current billing period. Reducing seats can typically take effect at the start of your next billing cycle (no refunds for mid-cycle reductions). We provide a simple seat management dashboard where admins can add or remove users anytime, and we'll adjust billing accordingly. Contact our support team if you have questions about specific adjustments.

---

### Q: Can we get a custom enterprise plan?

A: Yes. For large-scale deployments, specialized implementations, or organizations with unique requirements, we offer custom enterprise arrangements. Enterprise plans may include dedicated support, custom integrations with your existing systems, advanced reporting and analytics, and priority feature development. We also accommodate enterprise-specific billing arrangements and service level agreements. If you're interested in an enterprise plan, please contact our enterprise sales team directly to discuss your specific needs.

---

### Q: What support is included with organizational plans?

A: All organizational plans include email support during business hours and access to our help documentation. Standard plans typically include response times of 24-48 hours for non-urgent issues. We provide onboarding assistance for new organizations to ensure successful implementation. Premium support options are available (typically included in larger plans or available as add-ons) and include priority support, phone support, dedicated implementation specialists, and regular check-in calls. Details about support levels will be included in your specific quote.

---

### Q: Is there a volume discount for very large organizations?

A: Yes. Organizations with 100+ seats may qualify for volume discounts beyond our standard per-seat pricing. The more seats you need, the lower the per-seat cost typically becomes. We also offer tiered pricing structures where you commit to certain volume levels and receive corresponding discounts. To discuss volume pricing, please contact our enterprise sales team with details about your organization's size and needs.

---

### Q: What if we only need the platform for a specific department or program?

A: That's no problem. Many organizations start with a pilot program in one department before expanding platform-wide. You pay only for the seats you use. Once you've seen the success in one area, you can easily add more seats and expand to other departments. Many of our customers started small and grew their usage over time. We're happy to work with you to find a starting point that fits your budget and goals.

---

### Q: Are there any free versions or freemium options for organizations?

A: While job seekers receive the full platform for free, organizational plans are a paid offering. However, we understand that some organizations want to pilot the platform before larger commitments. We provide trial access (usually 30 days) that includes full platform features for a limited number of test users. This allows you to evaluate the platform's fit before purchasing seats. Contact our sales team to request a trial.

---

### Q: When does Career Forward launch and when can we subscribe?

A: Career Forward Platform is scheduled to launch in Q3 2026 (July-September 2026). Organizations interested in being early adopters or joining our launch partner program can reach out now to express interest and get on our priority list. We're offering special introductory pricing for organizations that commit before launch. If you'd like to be part of our launch, please contact our business development team.

---

### Q: Do you offer refunds if we're not satisfied?

A: We're confident in Career Forward's value for workforce development, and we back that with our satisfaction guarantee. Organizations that cancel within their first 30 days of a paid plan receive a full refund. We're also happy to work with organizations to address concerns or adjust their implementation. Our goal is your success, and we'll do what we can to ensure the platform delivers value for your team and the job seekers you serve.

---

### Q: What happens to our data if we cancel our subscription?

A: Your data is yours. If you cancel, your organization maintains access to all your job seekers' profiles, resumes, job tracking records, and coaching notes for 30 days. This gives you time to export data in standard formats (CSV, PDF) or integrate it with other systems. After 30 days, accounts transition to read-only mode, and you won't incur further charges. Job seekers can still access their own accounts and download their materials. For details about data export options, contact our support team.

---

### Q: Do you offer training or onboarding for organizations?

A: Yes. All organizational plans include onboarding support to ensure successful launch. Our team will help you understand platform features, best practices for coaches, setup for job seekers, and integration with your existing workflows. We provide documentation, video tutorials, and live training sessions tailored to your team's needs. For more comprehensive training or ongoing coaching, premium support tiers may include dedicated implementation specialists and regular check-in sessions.

---

### Q: Can we white-label Career Forward or customize pricing for our clients?

A: We support organizational branding and customization within the platform (colors, logos, messaging). For white-label or reseller pricing arrangements, we offer special terms for partners who want to offer Career Forward as part of their own service offerings. Contact our partnership team to discuss white-label or reseller opportunities and custom pricing arrangements.

---

### Q: What if we have questions about our invoice or billing?

A: Our billing support team is here to help. You can reach our billing department at billing@careerquestplatform.com or through your organization's dedicated account portal. We typically respond to billing inquiries within 24 business hours. For urgent issues or large organizations, contact your account manager directly. We're happy to clarify invoice details, discuss billing adjustments, or work through payment issues.

---

### Q: Is pricing the same for all regions or states?

A: Currently, Career Forward pricing is standardized across the United States. We don't have region-specific or state-specific pricing. However, pricing may vary based on volume, organization type (nonprofit, government, for-profit), and specific feature requirements. If you believe there are special circumstances affecting your organization, we're open to discussing custom pricing arrangements. Contact our sales team with details about your situation.
