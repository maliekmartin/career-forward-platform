### Q: What job application tracking features are available?

This keeps you accountable and helps you spot patterns in your job search.

---

As you find positions on our job board or elsewhere, you can add them to your tracker and organize them by status: applied, interviewing, rejected, or bookmarked for later. You can add notes about each application, set reminders to follow up, track important deadlines, and monitor your progress over time. This keeps everything organized in one place.

---

### Q: What information can I track for each job?

A: For each job in your tracker, you can record company name, position title, application date, application status, salary range, job description, contact information for hiring managers, interview dates, notes about the company or role, and follow-up reminders. You can also attach relevant documents like email confirmations or interview prep notes. This comprehensive tracking helps you remember important details.

When you follow up, reference the specific position and the date you applied, express continued interest, and briefly highlight why you're a strong fit.

This two-way confirmation ensures consent while maintaining data privacy.

---

The Activity Timeline shows exactly what actions clients took and when. Use filters to identify clients needing attention—those inactive 7+ days appear in your "Needs Attention" dashboard.

---

The flexible pathway allows clients to progress at their own pace. Coaches can add extensive private notes documenting barriers and accommodations.

A: The Client Detail View consolidates all essential client information in one location. Tabs show Overview (progress snapshot), Resumes (preview and download PDFs), Job Tracker (application history), Notes (your private coaching notes), and Activity (complete action timeline). This centralized view reduces time searching for information.

---

### Q: How can I identify clients needing attention?

A: The Dashboard prominently displays "Clients Needing Attention"—automatically flagged clients inactive 7+ days, 14+ days, or per your custom threshold. Filter your client list by status (Active, Inactive, At-Risk) to prioritize outreach. Yellow/Red status indicators visually identify at-risk clients.

If you connect with a career coach, that coach can view your profile information, resumes, job applications summary, and progress in read-only format—they cannot edit your data. Your employer, other job seekers, or unconnected third parties never have access to your personal information.

---

### Q: Is my resume shared with employers without consent?

A: No, your resume is never shared with employers without your explicit consent. You maintain complete control over your resume and when it's submitted to employers. When you log a job application through Career Forward, we don't automatically send anything to the employer—you decide when to apply and through which platform. We never sell, share, or distribute your resume data without your direct authorization.

---

### Q: Can organizations access my job seeker data?

A: Organizations do not have any access to your personal data through Career Forward. Your information is never shared with employers, recruitment agencies, or third-party organizations unless you explicitly choose to apply for a position. Career Forward is designed exclusively for your benefit as a job seeker—employers cannot search for, view, or access candidate information through our platform.

---

### Q: Can I delete my account and data?

A: Yes, you have complete control over your account and data. You can delete your account at any time through your settings page without providing a reason or waiting period. When you request account deletion, all your personal data is immediately removed from active systems. We maintain certain records only for legal compliance purposes for up to 12 months, but these are anonymized.

---

### Q: What happens to my data if my account becomes inactive?

A: We respect inactive accounts with a compassionate approach. If your account shows no activity for 30 days, we send you an email reminder. At 5 months of inactivity, we send a final warning email. If your account remains inactive for 6 months, we archive your account and securely store your resumes, which are emailed to you. After 12 months from archival, anonymized data is deleted.

---

### Q: What is your data retention policy?

A: For active accounts, your data is retained indefinitely as long as your account remains active. For inactive accounts (6+ months), your account data is archived but resumes are preserved and sent to your email. Deleted accounts have their data permanently removed after 12 months, with the exception of anonymized audit logs kept for compliance purposes.

---

### Q: Does Career Forward comply with GDPR and CCPA?

A: Yes, Career Forward is committed to compliance with both GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act). Under GDPR, EU residents have the right to access, correct, and delete their personal data, as well as the right to data portability. Under CCPA, California residents have the right to know what personal data we collect, delete personal information, and opt-out of data sales (which we don't do).

---

### Q: How does Career Forward handle third-party integrations?

A: Career Forward uses trusted, industry-standard third-party services to enhance your experience, but we maintain strict data governance. We integrate with Affinda for resume parsing, Resend for secure email delivery, and WorkSourceWA for job listings. These integrations only receive the minimum data necessary to provide their service. All third-party services are contractually bound to protect your data.

---

### Q: Is my data shared with third parties?

A: Your data is not sold or shared with third parties for marketing, advertising, or commercial purposes. We only share data with essential service providers (like Affinda for resume parsing and Resend for emails) strictly to deliver the services you use. These providers are contractually obligated to use your data only for the specified purpose. We never sell your data under any circumstances.

---

### Q: How are my login credentials protected?

A: Your password is protected by industry-standard bcrypt hashing with a high security cost factor, meaning your actual password is never stored on our servers—only a mathematical hash of it exists. We enforce strong password requirements (minimum 12 characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols). We also implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

---

### Q: What about session security and the "Remember Me" option?

A: Career Forward provides two session options for your convenience and security. Standard sessions expire after 24 hours. The "Remember Me" option extends your session to 30 days on trusted devices. Both options use HTTP-only secure session cookies that cannot be accessed by malicious scripts. Your session is immediately invalidated if you change your password.

---

### Q: How is my data access monitored?

A: Career Forward maintains comprehensive audit logs of all data access and modifications. We track every login, profile change, resume creation/edit, job application update, and admin action with timestamps, user information, and device details. Career coaches' access to your information is logged. You can access a summary of recent activity in your account's Activity Timeline.

---

### Q: What personal data does Career Forward collect?

A: We collect only the information necessary to help you advance your career. This includes your contact information (email, phone number), profile details (name, gender, years in industry, career goals), resume content (education, work experience, skills), job application records, career assessments and progress, video viewing history, and cover letters you create. You have control over this collection.

---

### Q: What happens if there's a security breach?

A: While we maintain industry-leading security measures, we recognize that no system is 100% immune. If a security incident occurs, Career Forward is committed to transparency and rapid response. We will notify affected users within 24 hours of confirming a breach, explaining what information was potentially compromised and what steps we're taking. Our security incident response team is on standby 24/7.

---

### Q: How do I request my data or exercise my privacy rights?

A: Exercising your privacy rights is straightforward and free. Within Career Forward, you can download a complete copy of your personal data at any time through your Account Settings under "Privacy & Data." For GDPR/CCPA requests or complex data inquiries, contact our privacy team at privacy@careerforward.com. We'll respond within 30 days.

---

### Q: Who is responsible for my data privacy?

A: Career Forward's Data Protection Officer (DPO) and Privacy team are responsible for ensuring compliance with all privacy regulations and maintaining the highest data protection standards. Our legal team reviews all data practices to ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable laws. You can contact our privacy team at privacy@careerforward.com with any concerns.

---

### Q: What can I do to keep my account secure?

A: Create a strong, unique password that you don't use elsewhere. Enable account notifications to immediately learn about suspicious activity. Use secure, updated devices and avoid public Wi-Fi when accessing sensitive information. Never share your password with anyone, and log out after each session if using a shared device. If you suspect unauthorized access, change your password immediately.

---

### Q: Is my information safe on shared or public devices?

A: Career Forward is designed to work on shared devices, but extra caution is recommended. Always use a private browsing window (incognito mode) on shared devices. Do NOT enable the "Remember Me" option on shared devices. Always manually log out after each session, and clear your browser cache and cookies.

---

### Q: Are my personal information and job search activity private and secure?

A: Absolutely! Your privacy and security are critically important to us. Career Forward uses industry-standard encryption to protect your personal information, login credentials, and job search data. Your information is never shared with employers or third parties without your permission, and employers cannot see your job tracker or private notes.

---

### Q: How is client data protected?

A: All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest in our database. We implement role-based access control so coaches only see connected clients. All data access is logged in the Audit Log for compliance verification. The platform supports HIPAA/FERPA-compliant deployments through privacy controls and data retention policies. User passwords use bcrypt encryption.
